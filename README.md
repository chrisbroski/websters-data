Conversion of the open-source Project Gutenberg dictionary to JSON and markdown.

I am using as the text source https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/673 which is in a sloppy and haphazard XML-ish format with weirdly encoded special characters. It's clearly a product of OCR and some conversion scripts, but is good enough to get what I want out of it.
